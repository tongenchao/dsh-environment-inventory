 * Host half: read-only reasoning-effort guidance.

 * (`UNSUPPORTED_REASONING_EFFORT` otherwise). This half therefore never
 * invents levels and never writes configuration: it diagnoses custom-provider
 * models the directory under-describes and returns copy-ready
 * `reasoningEfforts` declarations (exact when the knowledge base knows the
 * model, a filled template otherwise) for the user to paste into
 * `settings.yaml`. Built-in catalog models are trusted as-is and never
 * flagged.
